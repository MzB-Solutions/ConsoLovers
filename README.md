## Main features are:
* A [ConsoleMenu](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/blob/master/ConsoLovers/Menu/ConsoleMenu.cs) that supports Keyboard and Mouse selection.
  The menu is extremely customizable, supports color themes, index navigation and much more...
* A CommandLineEngine that offers parsing of command line arguments and mapping them to properties of a class 
* A MaskedInput class that can be used for password usecases (not secure ofcourse)
