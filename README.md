## Main features are:
* A [ConsoleMenu](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/blob/master/ConsoLovers/Menu/ConsoleMenu.cs) that supports Keyboard and Mouse selection.
  The menu is extremely customizable, supports color themes, index navigation and much more...
* A CommandLineEngine that offers parsing of command line arguments and mapping them to properties of a class 
* A [MaskedInput](https://github.com/bramerdaniel/ConsoLovers/blob/master/ConsoLovers/InputMask.cs) class that can be used for password scenarios.

## Usage

If a third party reference is not allowed in your project, you could also download the sources
